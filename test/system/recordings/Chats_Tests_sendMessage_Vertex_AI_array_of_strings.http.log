            "text": "The sky is blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sunlight and the Atmosphere:** Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n\n*   **Scattering of Light:** This collision causes the sunlight to scatter in different directions.  Rayleigh scattering is more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths of light.\n\n*   **Why Blue?** Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths compared to other colors like red and orange. Therefore, blue and violet light are scattered more strongly by the atmosphere than other colors.  Since our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet, we perceive the sky as blue.\n\n**Can the Sky Appear in Other Colors?**\n\nYes, the sky can appear in other colors, and it does so depending on various factors:\n\n*   **Sunrise and Sunset (Red and Orange):** At sunrise and sunset, the sun's light has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes.  This longer path means that much of the blue light has been scattered away before it reaches us.  The remaining light, which has longer wavelengths like red and orange, is then scattered towards our eyes, resulting in beautiful red and orange sunsets and sunrises.  Also, dust and particles in the air can further enhance the scattering of red and orange light, making the colors even more vibrant.\n\n*   **Cloudy Days (White or Gray):** When there are many clouds in the sky, the water droplets in the clouds are much larger than the air molecules responsible for Rayleigh scattering. These larger droplets scatter all colors of light approximately equally, in a process called Mie scattering.  This results in the sky appearing white or gray because all the colors of light are being scattered in all directions.\n\n*   **After Volcanic Eruptions (Red, Orange, Purple):** Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of dust and aerosols into the atmosphere. These particles can scatter light in unusual ways, leading to spectacular sunsets and sunrises with colors like deep reds, oranges, and even purples.\n\n*   **Other Planets:** The color of the sky on other planets depends on the composition of their atmospheres. For example:\n    *   **Mars:** The Martian sky is often a butterscotch color during the day due to dust particles suspended in its thin atmosphere. Sunsets can appear blue.\n    *   **Venus:** The thick atmosphere of Venus is believed to give it an orange or yellowish sky.\n    *   **Titan (Saturn's moon):** Titan has a thick, hazy atmosphere, and its sky is likely orange or tan.\n\nIn summary, while Rayleigh scattering is the primary reason the sky appears blue, other factors such as the angle of the sun, atmospheric conditions, and the presence of particles in the air can all influence the color of the sky.\n"
