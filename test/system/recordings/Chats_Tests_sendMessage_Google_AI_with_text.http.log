            "text": "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n*   **Sunlight and its colors:** Sunlight appears white, but it's actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow. Each color has a different wavelength (distance between the peaks of a wave). Blue and violet have shorter wavelengths, while red and orange have longer wavelengths.\n\n*   **The atmosphere:** The Earth's atmosphere is full of tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n\n*   **Scattering:** When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with these air molecules. This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n\n*   **Rayleigh scattering and wavelength:** Rayleigh scattering is more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths. This means blue and violet light are scattered much more strongly than red and orange light.\n\n*   **Why blue, not violet?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, there are a couple of reasons why we see the sky as blue:\n    *   Sunlight contains slightly less violet light than blue light.\n    *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet.\n\n*   **The result:** Because blue light is scattered more, it's spread all over the sky. When we look up, we see this scattered blue light from all directions. That's why the sky appears blue.\n\n**In simpler terms:** Imagine throwing different sized balls (representing different colors of light) at a bunch of small objects (air molecules). The smaller balls (blue light) will bounce around more wildly than the bigger balls (red light). Since the blue balls are bouncing all over the place, that's the color we see when we look at the \"ball pit\" (the sky).\n\n**Why are sunsets red?**\n\nAs the sun sets, the sunlight has to travel through a greater distance of atmosphere to reach our eyes. During this longer path, most of the blue light is scattered away. The red and orange light, with their longer wavelengths, are less likely to be scattered and can pass through the atmosphere to reach us. That's why sunsets often appear red or orange.\n"
