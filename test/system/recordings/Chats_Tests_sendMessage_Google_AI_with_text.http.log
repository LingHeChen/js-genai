            "text": "The sky is blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Sunlight and the Atmosphere:** Sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n\n*   **Scattering of Light:** This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n\n*   **Rayleigh Scattering and Wavelength:** Rayleigh scattering is more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) than longer wavelengths (red and orange). The amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. This means that blue light is scattered about ten times more strongly than red light.\n\n*   **Why Blue, Not Violet?:** Violet light is scattered even *more* than blue light. However, the sun emits less violet light than blue light, and our eyes are also less sensitive to violet. As a result, we see the sky as blue.\n\nIn simpler terms:\n\nImagine you're throwing a bunch of different sized balls (colors of light) at a bunch of small obstacles (air molecules). The smaller balls (blue light) are going to bounce off in all directions much more easily than the bigger balls (red light). That's why we see blue light coming from all directions in the sky.\n\n**Think of it like this:**\n\n*   **Sunlight = White light (mixture of all colors)**\n*   **Atmosphere = Tiny air molecules**\n*   **Blue light gets scattered the most**\n*   **Our eyes see the scattered blue light from all directions**\n\n**Why sunsets are red/orange:**\n\nWhen the sun is low on the horizon (during sunrise and sunset), sunlight has to travel through a much greater distance of the atmosphere. This means that most of the blue light is scattered away before it reaches our eyes. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are able to penetrate through the atmosphere and reach our eyes, giving us those beautiful red/orange sunsets."
