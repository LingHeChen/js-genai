            "text": "The sky is blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Sunlight and Colors:** Sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\n\n*   **Entering the Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n\n*   **Scattering:** This collision causes the sunlight to scatter in different directions.\n\n*   **Rayleigh Scattering:**  Rayleigh scattering is more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths of light. Shorter wavelengths correspond to colors like blue and violet.\n\n*   **Why Blue, Not Violet?**  Although violet light is scattered even *more* than blue light, there are a few reasons we see blue:\n    *   The sun emits less violet light than blue light.\n    *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n    *   Some violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere.\n\n*   **Our Perception:** Because blue light is scattered more effectively, it's dispersed throughout the atmosphere. When we look up, we see this scattered blue light coming from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n\n**Can the Sky Appear in Other Colors? Yes, it can!**\n\nHere's how:\n\n*   **Sunrise and Sunset (Red/Orange/Yellow):** At sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to travel through a much greater distance of atmosphere to reach our eyes.  This means the blue light has been scattered away almost completely by the time it reaches us. The longer wavelengths, like red, orange, and yellow, are scattered less and can make it through, coloring the sky in those hues.\n\n*   **Pollution and Haze (White/Gray):** Pollution and haze introduce larger particles into the atmosphere.  These larger particles scatter light differently through a process called Mie scattering, which scatters all colors of light more or less equally. This is why smoggy or hazy skies often appear white or gray.\n\n*   **Dust Storms (Yellow/Brown/Red):** In areas with dust storms, the sky can take on a yellow, brown, or reddish tint because dust particles scatter red light particularly well.\n\n*   **Other Planets:**  The color of the sky on other planets depends on the composition and density of their atmospheres. For example:\n    *   **Mars:** Has a thin atmosphere filled with reddish dust, so its sky appears butterscotch or pinkish-orange during the day.\n    *   **Titan (Saturn's moon):** Has a thick, hazy atmosphere, leading to an orange/brown sky.\n    *   **Venus:** The thick atmosphere leads to a yellow/orange sky.\n\nIn summary, while the *default* color of Earth's sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering, other factors can influence the color we see, making the sky a dynamic and beautiful canvas!\n"
