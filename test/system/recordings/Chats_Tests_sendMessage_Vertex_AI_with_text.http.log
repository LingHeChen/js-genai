            "text": "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sunlight:** Sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\n\n*   **Entering the Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n\n*   **Scattering:** These collisions cause the sunlight to scatter in different directions.\n\n*   **Rayleigh Scattering:** Rayleigh scattering is the type of scattering that affects shorter wavelengths of light more strongly. Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths than other colors like red, orange, and yellow.\n\n*   **Why Blue and Not Violet?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue, there's less violet light in sunlight to begin with. Our eyes are also less sensitive to violet light compared to blue. Additionally, the upper atmosphere absorbs some violet light.\n\n*   **The Result:** As a result, blue light is scattered much more than the other colors in sunlight. This scattered blue light spreads throughout the atmosphere, making the sky appear blue to our eyes.\n\n**Think of it like this:**\n\nImagine throwing a handful of ping pong balls (blue light) and a handful of larger balls (red light) at a bunch of trees (air molecules). The ping pong balls are more likely to bounce off the trees and scatter in all directions, while the larger balls are more likely to go straight through or be deflected less.\n\n**Why are sunsets red/orange?**\n\nWhen the sun is low on the horizon (during sunrise and sunset), sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. By the time the light reaches us, most of the blue light has been scattered away. The longer wavelengths of light, like red and orange, are less scattered and can travel through the atmosphere more easily, giving us those beautiful sunset colors.\n"
