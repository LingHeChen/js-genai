This is a classic problem. It immediately makes me think of arithmetic series and the standard formulas associated with them. Depending on the specifics, there might be shortcuts or more efficient ways to compute this, but the core issue is clearly calculating the summation of a sequence of integers. It's a fundamental concept, but the context here will define the best approach.  I'll need more information from the user to determine the most efficient solution, but this is a straightforward problem at its heart.\n",
